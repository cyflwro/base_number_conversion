# base_number_conversion

the only 2 base conversion function
in python i know are using bin() or hex().

but, i don't know how to do any other base in python.

so this function converts any number of base to another, valid from base 2 to base 20

this is my first publish ever on git hub 
its written in python

if using anaconda, save it in C:\Users\<username>\Anaconda2\....\Lib\site-packages

then in notebook, use import base2base in python

use help(base2base) to get a bit more info.

disclaimer: 
efficiency not tested
it was spot checked for correctness, but never validated with large dataset.
if you're willing please send me a large dataset so i can findout.
